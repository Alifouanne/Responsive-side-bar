# Responsive side bar
 
A responsive sidebar is a navigation menu located on the side of a webpage that adjusts to different screen sizes, making it easily accessible on any device. This sidebar is made using HTML and CSS, with a focus on clean, modern design and smooth transitions between sections. The dark-light mode feature allows users to switch between a dark or light color scheme, depending on their preference. The sidebar includes a variety of categories, such as "About Us", "Services", "Products", and more, which can be easily customized to suit the needs of the website.
